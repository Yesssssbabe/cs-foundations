What is the value of the final expression in this sequence?
 >>> f = min
 >>> f = max
 >>> g, h = min , max
 >>> max = g
 >>> max(f(2, g(h(1,5),3)),4)

Answer:3
 f → min, g → min, h → max
 Line 11: max → min , Line 9: f → max
 max (1, 5) → 5
 min (3, 5) → 3
 max (2, 3) → 3
 min (3, 4) → 3
 So, the answer is 3.

Defining Functions
Function definition is a more powerful means of abstraction: binds names to expressions

>>> def <name>(<formal parameters>):
        return <return expression>
Execution procedure for def statements:
1. Create a function with signature <name> (formal parameters>)
2. Set the body of that function to be everything indented after the first line
3. Bind <name> to that function in the current frame

Procedure for calling/applying user-defined functions (Version 1):
1. Add a local frame, forming a new environment
2. Bind the function's formal parameters to its arguments in that frame
3. Execute the body of the function in that new environment

Exp:
from operator import mul
def square(x):
    return mul(x, x)
square(-2)
