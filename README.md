# CS Foundations

This repository documents my journey into computer science, starting from the fundamentals.
It serves as a personal learning log covering programming, data structures, algorithms,
and small hands-on projects.

## Background

I am currently a first-year undergraduate student transitioning into Computer Science.
This repository reflects my self-study process alongside formal coursework, with a focus
on building solid foundations and practical problem-solving skills.

## Contents

- **Programming Basics**
  - Core syntax and concepts
  - Writing clean and readable code
  - Small exercises and experiments

- **Data Structures & Algorithms**
  - Arrays, strings, hash tables, stacks, queues, linked lists
  - Algorithmic thinking and complexity analysis
  - Practice problems and solutions

- **Mini Projects**
  - Small but complete programs
  - Emphasis on correctness, clarity, and maintainability

## Goals

- Build a strong foundation in computer science
- Develop the ability to solve problems using code
- Write code that is understandable, structured, and reusable
- Prepare for advanced CS coursework and future internships

## Notes

- This repository is continuously updated.
- Code quality and understanding matter more than quantity.
- Most projects and exercises are written during my first year of study.
